# Daily Work Schedular

## Description
This daily work schedular is a simple, yet effective way to organize any important tasks the user may have within each time block.

When the user opens the page, they should be met with the title of the page, as well as a brief description and also see the current day of the year.

The user may input any important information within the blank fields, and by simply clicking on the save icon, that information is stored into the local storage of their individual browser.  If the user closes the tab, they can re-open it at anytime and the page will repopulate any information saved into the local storage back into the correct time block.

As the day continues, the color within each time block will change depending on if that time was in the past, the future, or present.
